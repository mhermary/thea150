# Thea150 Website

This website was put together as a learning reflection from Thea150 (public speaking) taken at the University of Victoria during the fall 2022 semester.

It includes lessons learned and videos showing the progression of my public speaking skills throughout the term.

Also included are some journal reflections taken over the course of the term.
